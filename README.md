# Running application
the application is build o spring boot 2.0.2, to run it either from STS / intelliJ IDEs (originally developed on itelliJ) 
or you can use this command <code>java -jar path-to\reporting-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar</code>

to view DB you can use this url (don't forget to start the app first :-) ): <code>http://localhost/h2</code> (its an in-memory DB) 
I have also included swagger for API testing -and that's how I tested the REST service :S- and the url is: 
<code>http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#!/report45resource/getReportsUsingGET</code>
